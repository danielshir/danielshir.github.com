## About Codemonkeyz

Codemonkeyz.com is a blog I've been waiting to write for a while now.
It contains my thoughts, opinions, and various musings on everything from coding, to management to coffee.

## About me

I'm Daniel, I live in Tel Aviv Israel with my wife.
I'm an entrepreneur, a software developer and a huge coffee geek.
I programmed my first program in DOS QBasic back in 1995. Since then on continued onto Visual Basic and C/C++ on Windows 3.1. Right now I'm comfortable with pretty much every language out there, provided that it's open source.
While I do love computers, I do find the people that hack on them every day super interesting. In the art of software development, proper management is a somewhat neglected topic which I intend this blog to change (as much as I can).

Stuff I did professionally - 

* Work on incredibly complex code for the army
* Maintain the backend for a 100M user service all by myself 
* Become a freelance consultant and work with dozens of companies on improving their code and processes
* Start my own company (and eventually sell it)
